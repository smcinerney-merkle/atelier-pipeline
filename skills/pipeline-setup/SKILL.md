# Atelier Pipeline -- Setup

This skill installs the full Atelier Pipeline multi-agent orchestration system into the user's project.

> **Heads-up (Claude Code < 2.1.89):** Agent persona frontmatter declares an `effort` field (values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`) in addition to `model`. Claude Code runtimes older than **2.1.89** ignore the `effort` field silently -- the pipeline still functions, but effort-based promotion signals are not honoured by the runtime. See **ADR-0041** for the full effort-tier model. If your team is on an older Claude Code build, either upgrade or treat the `effort` field as documentation-only. Cursor users: the `effort` field is passed through as metadata; refer to Cursor release notes for runtime support.

## Setup Procedure

### Where Files Are Installed

Before gathering project information, understand where the pipeline installs files and how they interact with your project:

| Location | What Goes There | Git Status | Shared With Team? |
|----------|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| `.claude/rules/` | Eva persona, orchestration rules, model selection, branch lifecycle | Project-local, committed to repo | Yes -- team members get the same pipeline rules |
| `.claude/agents/` | Agent persona files (Sarah, Colby, etc.) | Project-local, committed to repo | Yes -- consistent agent behavior across the team |
| `.claude/commands/` | Slash command definitions (/pm, /pipeline, etc.) | Project-local, committed to repo | Yes -- same commands available to all |
| `.claude/references/` | Quality framework, invocation templates | Project-local, committed to repo | Yes -- shared knowledge base |
| `.claude/hooks/` | Enforcement scripts (path, sequencing, git guards) | Project-local, committed to repo | Yes -- same guardrails for everyone |
| `.claude/pipeline-config.json` | Branching strategy, feature flags | Project-local, committed to repo | Yes -- team-wide configuration |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Hook registrations (tells Claude Code to run the hooks) | Project-local, committed to repo | Yes -- hooks activate for all team members |
| `docs/pipeline/` | Pipeline state, context brief, error patterns | Project-local, committed to repo | Yes -- session recovery works across machines |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Pipeline section appended to project instructions | Project-local, committed to repo | Yes -- Claude Code reads this automatically |

**Key points:**
- All installed files live inside the project directory -- nothing is written to `~/.claude/` or other user-level locations.
- Everything is designed to be committed to git so team members inherit the pipeline when they clone.
- The plugin itself (installed via `claude plugin add`) is user-level, but the project files it generates are project-level.
- To remove all installed files later, use the `/pipeline-uninstall` skill.

### Step 0: Clean Up Deprecated quality-gate.sh

Before gathering any project information, unconditionally run this cleanup on every /pipeline-setup invocation. It is silent unless it finds something to remove.

1. **Check file:** Check if `.claude/hooks/quality-gate.sh` exists. If found: delete the file. Note that removal occurred.
2. **Check settings.json:** Check if `.claude/settings.json` exists and contains a hook entry referencing `quality-gate.sh` in any command string across all hook event types (PreToolUse, SubagentStop, PreCompact, etc.). If found:
   - Parse the JSON. If the JSON is malformed or invalid, log a warning ("Warning: .claude/settings.json is malformed JSON -- skipping quality-gate.sh entry removal. Does not block setup.") and continue to step 3.
   - Remove the hook entry containing "quality-gate" from the command string.
   - If removing that entry leaves an empty hooks array for an event type, remove the event type entry entirely (no empty arrays left behind).
   - Write the updated JSON back to `.claude/settings.json`.
   - Note that removal occurred.
3. **Print notice (conditional):** If either artifact was found and removed: print exactly `Removed deprecated quality-gate.sh (see retro lesson #003).`
4. **Silent no-op:** If neither found: do nothing. No output.

**Edge case handling:**
- File exists but settings.json entry already removed: detect file, delete it, print notice. Check settings.json independently of file existence.
- settings.json has quality-gate.sh entry but file does not exist: detect entry in settings.json, remove it, print notice.
- Both found: remove both, print single notice (not two).
- Neither found: silent no-op.

This cleanup targets only quality-gate.sh entries. Other hook entries (enforce-eva-paths.sh, enforce-sequencing.sh, enforce-git.sh, etc.) are not affected.

### Step 0b: Clean Up Orphan Brain-Capture Hooks

Unconditionally run this cleanup on every /pipeline-setup invocation. Silent unless it finds something to remove.

1. **Check prompt-brain-capture.sh:** If `.claude/hooks/prompt-brain-capture.sh` exists, delete it with `rm -f .claude/hooks/prompt-brain-capture.sh`. Note that removal occurred.
2. **Check warn-brain-capture.sh:** If `.claude/hooks/warn-brain-capture.sh` exists, delete it with `rm -f .claude/hooks/warn-brain-capture.sh`. Note that removal occurred.
3. **Print notice (conditional):** If either file was found and removed: print exactly `Removed orphan brain-capture hooks (superseded by brain-extractor agent).`
4. **Silent no-op:** If neither found: do nothing. No output.

### Step 0c: Clean Up Orphan session-hydrate.sh Registration

Unconditionally run this cleanup on every /pipeline-setup invocation. Silent unless it finds something to remove.

`session-hydrate.sh` is now an intentional no-op (superseded by the `atelier_hydrate` MCP tool) and must NOT be registered in `.claude/settings.json`. Older installs may still have a registration entry.

1. **Check settings.json:** Check if `.claude/settings.json` exists and contains a hook entry whose command string contains exactly `session-hydrate.sh` (not `session-hydrate-enforcement.sh` or other similarly-named hooks) across all hook event types (SessionStart is the typical location). If found:
   - Parse the JSON. If the JSON is malformed or invalid, log a warning ("Warning: .claude/settings.json is malformed JSON -- skipping session-hydrate.sh entry removal. Does not block setup.") and continue to Step 1 (Gather Project Information).
   - Remove the hook entry containing "session-hydrate.sh" from the command string.
   - If removing that entry leaves an empty hooks array for an event type, remove the event type entry entirely (no empty arrays left behind).
   - Write the updated JSON back to `.claude/settings.json`.
   - Note that removal occurred.
2. **Print notice (conditional):** If the entry was found and removed: print exactly `Removed orphan session-hydrate.sh registration (intentional no-op, see source comment).`
3. **Silent no-op:** If not found: do nothing. No output.

**Note:** The `.claude/hooks/session-hydrate.sh` file itself is NOT deleted — it is re-copied by Step 3a as an intentional no-op backward-compatibility shim. Only the `settings.json` registration is removed.

This cleanup targets only session-hydrate.sh registrations. Other hook entries are not affected.

### Step 0d: Clean Up Orphan atelier-brain .mcp.json Entry

Unconditionally run this cleanup on every /pipeline-setup invocation. Silent unless it finds something to remove.

The Atelier Brain MCP server is now registered and managed entirely by the plugin. Older installs may have a stale project-level `.mcp.json` entry that must be removed.

1. **Check .mcp.json:** Check if `.mcp.json` exists in the project root and contains an "atelier-brain" key under the `mcpServers` object. If found, atomically remove atelier-brain and delete the file if mcpServers is empty. Run via Bash:

   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import json, os
   p = '.mcp.json'
   if not os.path.exists(p): exit(0)
   try:
       d = json.load(open(p))
   except Exception:
       print('Warning: .mcp.json is malformed JSON -- skipping atelier-brain entry removal. Does not block setup.')
       exit(0)
   d.get('mcpServers', {}).pop('atelier-brain', None)
   if not d.get('mcpServers'):
       os.remove(p)
   else:
       json.dump(d, open(p, 'w'), indent=2)
   "
   ```

   Then run the safety-net check — if `.mcp.json` still exists with empty or absent `mcpServers`, delete it unconditionally:

   ```bash
   if [ -f .mcp.json ]; then python3 -c "import json,os,sys; d=json.load(open('.mcp.json')); sys.exit(0) if d.get('mcpServers') else os.remove('.mcp.json')" 2>/dev/null; fi
   ```

   Note that removal occurred.
2. **Print notice (conditional):** If the entry was found and removed: print exactly `Removed stale atelier-brain .mcp.json entry (now managed by plugin).`
3. **Silent no-op:** If not found: do nothing. No output.

This cleanup targets only atelier-brain entries. Other MCP server entries in `.mcp.json` are not affected.

### Step 0e: Migrate Stale Brain MCP `permissions.allow` Entries (ADR-0055)

Unconditionally run this cleanup on every /pipeline-setup invocation. Silent unless it finds something to remove.

Per ADR-0055, the brain is moving from this pipeline plugin into the standalone `mybrain` plugin. The 8 `permissions.allow` entries written by older `brain-setup` runs use the bundled-plugin prefix `mcp__plugin_atelier-pipeline_atelier-brain__`. After Phase 3 these entries no longer match any registered tool — they are dead weight. Removing them now is safe: when the user re-runs `/brain-setup` against the current brain plugin, the correct entries are re-added.

1. **Check settings.json:** Check if `.claude/settings.json` exists and contains any `permissions.allow` entry whose value starts with the prefix `mcp__plugin_atelier-pipeline_atelier-brain__`. If found:

   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import json, os
   p = '.claude/settings.json'
   if not os.path.exists(p):
       exit(0)
   try:
       s = json.load(open(p))
   except json.JSONDecodeError:
       print('Warning: .claude/settings.json is malformed JSON -- skipping ADR-0055 brain permissions cleanup. Does not block setup.')
       exit(0)
   allow = (s.get('permissions') or {}).get('allow') or []
   stale_prefix = 'mcp__plugin_atelier-pipeline_atelier-brain__'
   keep = [t for t in allow if not (isinstance(t, str) and t.startswith(stale_prefix))]
   removed = len(allow) - len(keep)
   if removed:
       s.setdefault('permissions', {})['allow'] = keep
       json.dump(s, open(p, 'w'), indent=2)
       print(f'Removed {removed} stale brain permission entries (ADR-0055).')
   "
   ```

2. **Print notice (conditional):** The python snippet prints `Removed N stale brain permission entries (ADR-0055).` when it removes anything. Re-run `/brain-setup` after upgrading to the standalone brain plugin to re-add the correct entries.
3. **Silent no-op:** If no stale entries are found, the snippet prints nothing.

This cleanup targets only entries with the `mcp__plugin_atelier-pipeline_atelier-brain__` prefix. Other `permissions.allow` entries (e.g., `Edit`, `Bash(...)`, other plugins' MCP tools) are not affected.

### Step 0f: Brain Migration Wizard (ADR-0056)

This step is a **one-time** migration wizard for users who installed the brain when it was bundled inside this plugin (ADR-0055 Phase 1 / Phase 2). Phase 3 deletes `brain/` from the plugin tree and moves the brain into the standalone `mybrain` plugin. The wizard hands the user from the old bundled brain to mybrain without losing data, or — if the user prefers — wipes the existing database and starts fresh against mybrain.

The wizard runs **at most once per install**. After a successful migration, the detection signals no longer match and Step 0f is a silent no-op on every subsequent `/pipeline-setup` invocation. Idempotency is the load-bearing contract — running this skill twice on a freshly migrated install must NOT re-trigger any destructive action.

#### S0 — Detect

Run all three detection signals silently. The wizard activates **only when all three** are true (logical AND, not OR — any single signal alone produces false positives in long-lived projects).

1. **mybrain is absent from the runtime tool registry.** Probe ToolSearch for any tool whose name matches the pattern `mcp__*mybrain*` or `mcp__*atelier-brain__*` (the suffix-match pattern from ADR-0055 Phase 1). If any matching tool resolves, the user is already on mybrain (or some compatible brain) — exit Step 0f silently.
2. **A `.claude/brain-config.json` exists whose `database_url` references a reachable Postgres instance.** Read the file (use the same `python3 -c "import json; print(json.dumps(json.load(open('.claude/brain-config.json'))))"` pattern used by `/brain-setup` Path A). If absent or malformed, exit Step 0f silently. Otherwise, expand `${ENV_VAR}` placeholders against the current environment and run a `SELECT 1` reachability probe via `psql "<expanded_url>" -c "SELECT 1;"` (timeout 5s). If the probe fails, exit Step 0f silently — the wizard refuses to act on ambiguous state. Use the brain-uninstall skill's database-strategy detection logic to classify the URL as Docker / Local / Remote (this is needed in S3 below).
3. **The bundled-brain artifact is present.** Check `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/brain/server.mjs` is readable. Phase 3 deletes this file from the source tree. If it is present in the user's `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, they are on the upgrade boundary — exactly when the wizard should run. If absent, exit Step 0f silently (the user has already upgraded past Phase 3 OR has a stale install with a present config, in which case `/brain-setup` running later in this skill handles them).

If any of the three signals is false, exit Step 0f silently and proceed to Step 1 (Gather Project Information). **Do not announce that you ran the detection.**

If all three signals are true, proceed to S1.

#### S1 — Inform & Consent

Tell the user exactly what is about to happen, present the multi-project shared-DB warning, and offer the migrate vs. start-fresh fork. Wait for explicit consent before proceeding.

Print:

```
A bundled brain installation was detected.

The Atelier Brain has moved to a standalone plugin called `mybrain` (ADR-0055).
This pipeline plugin no longer ships a brain server. To keep your captured
thoughts, decisions, patterns, and lessons working, the brain plugin needs
to migrate.

Your existing brain data will NOT be lost. The database and all its contents
are preserved. Only the brain server process is changing.

If this Postgres database is shared with other atelier-pipeline projects,
the schema migration will affect all of them. Existing data is preserved
(additive migration — new columns added, nothing dropped or renamed).

Two paths are available:

  1. MIGRATE  -- Preserve your existing brain database and re-attach it to
                 mybrain. The wizard takes a backup, stops the old bundled
                 brain, walks you through installing mybrain, and verifies
                 the additive schema migration on first connect. Same DB,
                 same data, same config keys, different MCP server.

  2. FRESH    -- Start over. The wizard drops the existing schema (after a
                 backup), installs mybrain, and lets it create a brand-new
                 brain database against the same Postgres instance.

  3. CANCEL   -- Take no action. The wizard exits without changes. You can
                 re-run /pipeline-setup anytime to revisit.

Which path would you like? (migrate / fresh / cancel)
```

If the user says **cancel** (or anything other than `migrate`/`fresh`): print "Wizard cancelled. Re-run `/pipeline-setup` to revisit." Exit Step 0f. Proceed to Step 1.

If the user says **migrate**: enter the migrate track (S2 → S3 → S4 → S5 → S6).

If the user says **fresh**: enter the fresh track (S2-fresh → S3-fresh → S4-fresh → S5-fresh → S6-fresh).

In both cases, before proceeding to S2 / S2-fresh, capture the timestamp `migration_ts` for the backup filename (`date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S`) and announce: "Starting migration. Current state: S1 → S2."

#### S2 — Backup (migrate path)

Tell the user what will happen before doing it: "I will take a `pg_dump` backup of your existing brain database to `~/.atelier-brain-backup-{migration_ts}.sql`. This is your insurance policy — if anything goes wrong in a later step, you can restore from this file."

1. **Check `pg_dump` availability.** Run `command -v pg_dump`. If on PATH, proceed to step 2. If not on PATH:
   - Print the manual command the user can run themselves:
     ```
     pg_dump <expanded_database_url> > ~/.atelier-brain-backup-{migration_ts}.sql
     ```
   - Ask: "I cannot find `pg_dump` on PATH (common when your DB is remote and you have no local Postgres tooling). Do you have your own backup, or have you run the command above? Type `yes` to confirm and proceed without me taking the backup, or type `cancel` to exit the wizard."
   - If the user types anything other than exactly `yes`: HALT. Print "S2 HALT: backup acknowledgement not given. Wizard cancelled with no changes." Exit Step 0f. **Do not proceed.**
   - If the user types `yes`: record `backup_path = "(user-managed)"` and proceed to S3.

2. **Take the backup.** Expand `${ENV_VAR}` placeholders in `database_url` against the current environment, then run:
   ```bash
   pg_dump "<expanded_database_url>" > ~/.atelier-brain-backup-{migration_ts}.sql
   ```
   Capture exit code. If non-zero: HALT. Print:
   ```
   S2 HALT — pg_dump failed.

   Current state: old brain still installed, no changes have been made.
   Backup attempt path: ~/.atelier-brain-backup-{migration_ts}.sql
   pg_dump exit code: <code>
   pg_dump stderr: <last 20 lines>

   To resume the wizard later, fix the backup issue and re-run /pipeline-setup.
   To abandon the migration, take no action — your install is unchanged.
   ```
   Exit Step 0f. **Do not proceed.**

3. **Confirm the backup.** Print: "Backup saved to `~/.atelier-brain-backup-{migration_ts}.sql`. To restore later: `psql <expanded_database_url> < ~/.atelier-brain-backup-{migration_ts}.sql`." Record `backup_path`. Proceed to S3.

#### S2-fresh — Backup (fresh path)

Same procedure as S2, with one difference in framing: emphasize that this backup is what lets the user undo the fresh-start if they change their mind. Print before taking the dump: "Even though you chose `fresh`, I'm taking a backup first. If you change your mind after the schema is dropped, you can restore from this file."

All other behavior (PATH check, halt on failure, halt on missing acknowledgement) is identical to S2. Proceed to S3-fresh on success.

#### S3 — Stop & Remove Old Brain (migrate path)

Tell the user what is about to happen: "I am about to stop the old bundled brain. I will NOT drop tables, I will NOT remove `.claude/brain-config.json`, and I will NOT remove the `ATELIER_BRAIN_DB_PASSWORD` environment variable. Your existing brain data will NOT be lost. The database and all its contents are preserved. Only the brain server process is changing."

1. **Detect the database strategy** from `database_url` (already classified at S0). Behavior diverges per strategy:

   - **Docker:** Run `docker compose -f ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/brain/docker-compose.yml ps` to check container status. If the `brain-db` container is running, run `docker compose -f ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/brain/docker-compose.yml down`. Capture the exit code. **Do NOT pass `-v` — the volume must survive so the data is preserved across the migration.** If `down` fails: HALT. Print:
     ```
     S3 HALT — docker compose down failed.

     Current state: backup saved at <backup_path>; old brain container may still
     be running. To recover: stop the container manually with
     `docker compose -f ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/brain/docker-compose.yml down`
     and re-run /pipeline-setup. Backup is still valid.
     ```
     Exit Step 0f.

   - **Local PostgreSQL / Remote PostgreSQL:** No container to stop. The bundled brain runs as an MCP server process spawned by Claude Code; once Phase 3 deletes `brain/`, that process can no longer be spawned. Print: "Your brain runs as a local/remote PostgreSQL connection — there's no separate container or daemon to stop. The bundled brain MCP server stops automatically when the plugin upgrade removes `brain/server.mjs`." Proceed.

2. **Do NOT delete `.claude/brain-config.json`.** Mybrain accepts identical config keys (`database_url`, `scope`, `brain_name`, `openrouter_api_key`, and the ADR-0054 multi-provider fields under identical names). The config is a hand-off, not a translation. Leave the file in place.

3. **Do NOT touch `permissions.allow` directly.** Step 0e earlier in this skill already strips the stale `mcp__plugin_atelier-pipeline_atelier-brain__` prefix entries on every run; mybrain's `brain-setup` re-adds the new-prefixed entries when the user runs it post-install (S4 below).

4. Confirm: "Old brain stopped. Backup at `<backup_path>`. To roll back at this point: restart the bundled brain via `docker compose -f ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/brain/docker-compose.yml up -d` (Docker only — local/remote setups never had a separate process to restart)."

Proceed to S4.

#### S3-fresh — Drop Schema (fresh path)

Tell the user what will happen: "I am about to DROP the existing brain schema. All thoughts, decisions, patterns, lessons, and relations stored in this database will be permanently deleted. The Postgres database itself remains; only the schema contents go. Your backup at `<backup_path>` is your only recovery path if you change your mind."

1. **Final confirmation.** Ask: "Type exactly `DROP` (uppercase, no quotes) to proceed. Anything else cancels the fresh-start path." If the user types anything other than exactly `DROP`: HALT. Print "S3-fresh HALT: drop confirmation not given. Wizard cancelled with no changes." Exit Step 0f.

2. **Drop the schema.** Expand `${ENV_VAR}` placeholders in `database_url`, then run:
   ```bash
   psql "<expanded_database_url>" -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"
   ```
   Capture exit code. If non-zero: HALT. Print:
   ```
   S3-fresh HALT — schema drop failed.

   Current state: backup saved at <backup_path>; schema may be in partial state.
   psql exit code: <code>
   psql stderr: <last 20 lines>

   To recover: connect with psql and inspect the schema state, then drop manually:
     psql <expanded_database_url> -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"
   To abandon the fresh-start: restore from backup with
     psql <expanded_database_url> < <backup_path>
   ```
   Exit Step 0f.

3. **Stop the old bundled brain** using the same per-strategy logic as S3 step 1 (Docker `compose down`, local/remote no-op). HALT semantics identical to S3.

4. Confirm: "Schema dropped. Old brain stopped. Backup at `<backup_path>`."

Proceed to S4-fresh.

#### S4 — Install mybrain (migrate path)

Tell the user: "I cannot install plugins on your behalf — that requires Claude Code's plugin manager. I will print the install command, and you run it in another shell, then come back here and confirm."

1. Print the install command:
   ```
   Run this in another terminal (or in this one after I finish):

     claude plugin install <mybrain-source-url>

   See the mybrain plugin's README for the exact source URL. The plugin
   will register itself as an MCP server with tool prefix
   `mcp__plugin_mybrain__` (or similar — the suffix-match in the pipeline
   gate hooks accepts any prefix).

   Once the install completes and Claude Code reloads, type `installed`
   to continue, or `cancel` to abort the wizard.
   ```

2. Wait for user input. If the user types anything other than `installed`: HALT. Print "S4 HALT: mybrain install not confirmed. Backup at `<backup_path>`. Wizard exited; re-run `/pipeline-setup` after installing mybrain to resume from this point — the wizard's idempotency check at S0 will detect that mybrain is now registered and skip the rest of Step 0f silently."

3. **Probe ToolSearch to verify mybrain is registered.** Run:
   ```
   ToolSearch query: select:mcp__*__atelier_stats,mcp__*mybrain*
   ```
   If no mybrain-prefixed tool resolves: HALT. Print:
   ```
   S4 HALT — mybrain ToolSearch probe failed.

   Current state: old brain stopped, mybrain not yet detected by Claude Code.
   Backup at <backup_path>.

   This usually means Claude Code has not reloaded the plugin registry. Try:
     1. Reload Claude Code (Cmd+R / restart the session).
     2. Verify the plugin is installed: `claude plugin list | grep mybrain`.
     3. Re-run /pipeline-setup. The wizard's S0 detection will skip Step 0f
        once mybrain is registered.

   To roll back to the bundled brain: uninstall mybrain (`claude plugin uninstall mybrain`),
   reinstall the previous version of atelier-pipeline that still bundles brain/,
   and run `psql <expanded_database_url> < <backup_path>` if any schema changes
   were applied.
   ```
   Exit Step 0f.

4. Confirm: "mybrain is registered. Proceeding to schema verification."

Proceed to S5.

#### S4-fresh — Install mybrain (fresh path)

Identical to S4. The mybrain install command and ToolSearch probe are the same; only the database state differs (empty schema after S3-fresh vs. preserved data after S3). Proceed to S5-fresh on success.

#### S5 — Verify & Migrate Schema (migrate path) — HIGHEST RISK STATE

Tell the user: "Mybrain is now connecting to your existing brain database. On first connect, mybrain runs `runMigrations()` which applies the additive v1→merged migration. Existing data is preserved (new columns are added; nothing is dropped or renamed). I will probe `/health` and run `atelier_stats` to verify the migration succeeded."

This is the **highest-risk state** because: old brain is stopped, mybrain is installed, the database has been touched by `runMigrations()`, and a failure here leaves the user with a half-migrated DB. The HALT message MUST include the exact recovery command — that contract is the load-bearing piece.

1. **Probe mybrain `/health` endpoint.** Mybrain exposes `GET /health` returning `{"status":"ok"}` (per ADR-0055 §Decision). Use the appropriate transport for the user's platform — typically `curl http://localhost:<mybrain-port>/health` or invoke the mybrain `atelier_stats` MCP tool directly.

2. **Run `atelier_stats`** via the now-registered mybrain MCP tool. If it returns a non-empty result with `brain_enabled: true` (or the equivalent ready signal mybrain emits), the migration succeeded.

3. **On success:** Print "Schema migrated. mybrain reports `<N>` tools available, `<scope>` scope active. Proceeding to S6 (cleanup)." Proceed to S5 → S6.

4. **On failure (health probe fails OR atelier_stats fails OR runMigrations error in mybrain logs):** HALT. Print this exact message — the rollback contract requires it:

   ```
   S5 HALT — schema migration failed at the highest-risk state.

   This is the state where:
     - The old bundled brain is stopped.
     - mybrain is installed and registered.
     - Your database is in a partial migration state (runMigrations may have
       applied some columns / tables but not others).

   To recover, run the exact restore command:

     psql <expanded_database_url> < <backup_path>

   This restores your database to the pre-migration state. Then:
     1. Pin mybrain to a known-good version (see mybrain release notes).
     2. Re-run /pipeline-setup. The wizard's S0 detection will not re-trigger
        on the same database (mybrain is registered) — you will need to
        manually clear and re-attempt the migration with mybrain support.

   Backup retained at: <backup_path>
   Database URL: <expanded_database_url>
   Migration ts: <migration_ts>
   ```

   Exit Step 0f.

#### S5-fresh — Verify (fresh path)

Identical to S5 but the database is empty so `runMigrations()` is a fresh apply of the merged schema, not an additive migration on existing data. The probe and HALT semantics are the same. On failure HALT message: same structure as S5, but the recovery command is `psql <expanded_database_url> -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"` followed by re-running `/brain-setup` from the new mybrain plugin. Proceed to S6-fresh on success.

#### S6 — Clear Sentinels & Confirm

1. **Remove sentinel files.** If `docs/pipeline/.brain-not-installed` exists, delete it. If `docs/pipeline/.brain-unavailable` exists, delete it. These were touched by previous sessions when the bundled brain was unreachable; mybrain is now live, so they are stale.

2. **Run a final round-trip.** Call `agent_capture` with a minimal probe payload (`thought_type: 'lesson'`, content: "Brain migration to mybrain completed via Step 0f wizard."), then `agent_search` for the captured content. If both succeed, the migration is verified end-to-end.

3. **On success — print the success summary:**
   ```
   Brain migration complete.

   What changed:
     - Bundled brain server stopped and removed (Phase 3 of ADR-0055).
     - mybrain plugin registered and serving the brain MCP tools.
     - Schema migrated additively (your existing data is preserved).
     - Sentinel files cleared.

   Backup retained at: <backup_path>
   You own retention. Delete it manually when you are confident the migration
   stuck (recommended: keep it for at least a few full pipeline cycles).

   To re-run brain-setup against the new mybrain plugin (e.g., to refresh
   permissions.allow entries with mybrain's tool prefix), run /brain-setup
   from the mybrain plugin.
   ```

4. **On round-trip failure:** Print a soft warning (do NOT halt — mybrain is non-blocking per ADR-0053 / ADR-0055):
   ```
   S6 SOFT WARNING — final round-trip probe did not return cleanly. Brain
   migration is structurally complete, but agent_capture / agent_search did
   not round-trip on this attempt. Your pipeline still works because the
   brain is non-blocking. Re-run /brain-setup against mybrain to diagnose.

   Backup retained at: <backup_path>
   ```
   Exit Step 0f normally.

#### S6-fresh — Confirm (fresh path)

Same as S6 but the success message reads "Brain reset complete" rather than "migration complete," and notes that the previous data has been deleted (the backup is the only copy of it).

#### Step 0f Idempotency

After successful migration, the next `/pipeline-setup` invocation hits S0 and exits silently (mybrain is registered → signal 1 fails). This is the load-bearing idempotency contract. If a partially-migrated install re-triggers the wizard (e.g., S2 succeeded but S5 failed), the user must follow the HALT recovery command first; the wizard does not auto-resume from arbitrary failure states. Once the user restores the backup or completes recovery manually, the next run hits S0 with old-brain-still-bundled-but-mybrain-registered, signal 1 fails, and Step 0f exits silently.

#### Step 0f Config Key Migration

There is no config key translation. Mybrain accepts every key the atelier-brain `brain-config.json` writes — `database_url`, `scope`, `brain_name`, `openrouter_api_key`, `embedding_provider` / `embedding_model` / `embedding_api_key` / `embedding_base_url`, `chat_provider` / `chat_model` / `chat_api_key` / `chat_base_url` — under the same names. The wizard does NOT rename any keys, does NOT translate any values, and does NOT rewrite `.claude/brain-config.json`. The migration is a hand-off, not a translation.

The `permissions.allow` rewrite is handled by Step 0e earlier in this skill (which strips the stale `mcp__plugin_atelier-pipeline_atelier-brain__` prefix on every run); mybrain's own `brain-setup` skill re-adds the new-prefixed entries when the user runs it.

### Step 0g: Remove Deprecated dashboard_mode Key

Unconditionally run this cleanup on every /pipeline-setup invocation. Silent unless it finds something to remove.

`dashboard_mode` was removed in ADR-0060. Older installs may carry the key.

1. **Check pipeline-config.json:** If `.claude/pipeline-config.json` exists and contains a `dashboard_mode` key, remove it. Write the result to a temporary file then rename it into place so a mid-write failure cannot corrupt the config:

   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import json, os
   p = '.claude/pipeline-config.json'
   if not os.path.exists(p): exit(0)
   try:
       d = json.load(open(p))
   except Exception:
       exit(0)
   if 'dashboard_mode' not in d: exit(0)
   del d['dashboard_mode']
   tmp = p + '.tmp'
   with open(tmp, 'w') as f:
       json.dump(d, f, indent=2)
   os.replace(tmp, p)
   print('Removed deprecated dashboard_mode from .claude/pipeline-config.json (ADR-0060).')
   "
   ```

2. **Silent no-op:** If the key is absent, the script prints nothing.

### Step 0h: Wire Brain Capture Gate Hooks in settings.json

Unconditionally run this migration on every /pipeline-setup invocation. It is silent unless it makes a change. This step ensures the brain-capture gate hooks introduced in ADR-0053 are correctly wired and ordered in existing installations.

Three things to fix:

**A. Agent PreToolUse — gate and reminder before sequencing**

The brain-capture gate must fire before enforce-sequencing.sh so that Eva resolves any pending brain capture before hitting the sequencing check. The prompt reminder must fire before the gate.

1. Check `.claude/settings.json`. If missing or malformed, skip silently.
2. Find the `PreToolUse` Agent matcher hooks group.
3. Separate prompt-type hooks from command-type hooks. Within the hooks array, apply this target order:
   - First: `prompt-brain-capture-reminder.sh` (prompt type) — add if missing
   - Second: `enforce-brain-capture-gate.sh` (command type) — add if missing; move to front if present elsewhere
   - Then: `enforce-sequencing.sh`, followed by all other existing hooks in their current relative order
4. If the hooks were already in this order and both hooks were already present, no change needed for this group.

**B. SubagentStop — enforce-brain-capture-pending.sh**

Writes `.pending-brain-capture.json` when an allowlisted agent stops, enabling the gate to block the next Agent invocation.

1. Find the `SubagentStop` hooks group (there is only one).
2. If a command hook referencing `enforce-brain-capture-pending.sh` is not present, insert it. Insert it after the `enforce-colby-stop-verify.sh` entry if that entry is present, otherwise insert it before any prompt or agent-type hooks (so it runs early in the stop sequence).

**C. PostToolUse — clear-brain-capture-pending.sh**

Clears `.pending-brain-capture.json` when `agent_capture` succeeds, releasing the gate.

1. Check if a `PostToolUse` key exists in `hooks`.
2. If absent, add:
   ```json
   "PostToolUse": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/clear-brain-capture-pending.sh"}]}]
   ```
3. If present, check whether any hook entry in any group references `clear-brain-capture-pending.sh`. If not, append `{"type": "command", "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/clear-brain-capture-pending.sh"}` to the first group's hooks array.

**Implementation — run via Bash:**

```bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'
import json, os, sys

p = '.claude/settings.json'
if not os.path.exists(p):
    sys.exit(0)

try:
    with open(p) as f:
        s = json.load(f)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print('Warning: .claude/settings.json is malformed JSON -- skipping Step 0h brain capture gate migration.')
    sys.exit(0)

changed = False
hooks = s.setdefault('hooks', {})

PRJ = '"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/.claude/hooks/'

def hook_ref(h):

    return h.get('command') or h.get('prompt') or h.get('agent') or ''

# ── A. PreToolUse Agent reorder ──────────────────────────────────────────────

    )

    if needs_reorder:
        # Strip any existing reminder/gate entries (will re-add at front).
        rest = [h for h in arr if REMINDER_CMD not in hook_ref(h) and GATE_CMD not in hook_ref(h)]

else:
    all_post_hooks = [h for g in post_groups for h in g.get('hooks', [])]
    if not any(CLEAR_CMD in hook_ref(h) for h in all_post_hooks):

        changed = True

if changed:
    with open(p, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(s, f, indent=2)
    print('Wired brain capture gate hooks in .claude/settings.json (Step 0h).')
PYEOF
```

**Print notice (conditional):** The script prints `Wired brain capture gate hooks in .claude/settings.json (Step 0h).` when it makes changes.
**Silent no-op:** If all three conditions are already satisfied, the script prints nothing.

This migration is safe to run on any settings.json — it only adds or reorders hook entries, never removes existing hooks.

### Step 1: Gather Project Information

Before installing, ask the user about their project. Ask these questions conversationally, one at a time -- do not dump a list.

**Required information:**

0. **Project name** -- A short identifier for this project (e.g., "syntetiq", "atelier-pipeline", "my-app"). Used in telemetry scope for cross-project tracking. Ask: "What should I call this project in telemetry reports?"
1. **Tech stack** -- Language, framework, runtime (e.g., "React 19 with Vite, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL")
2. **Test framework** -- What testing library/runner (e.g., "Vitest", "Jest", "pytest", "cargo test")
3. **Test commands** -- The exact commands for:
   - **Lint command** -- fast lint/typecheck checks with no DB or external dependencies, used by agents during their workflow (e.g., `npm run lint && tsc --noEmit`, `black --check . && ruff check . && mypy .`).
   - **Full test suite** -- the complete test suite including DB-dependent and integration tests, used by Poirot for QA verification (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest --cov`). Runs once per work unit.
   - Running a single test file (e.g., `npx vitest run path/to/file`)
4. **Source structure** -- Where features, components, services, and routes live. Specifically ask for:
   - **Project source directory** -- Root directory for source code (e.g., `src/`, `lib/`, `app/`)
   - **Feature directory pattern** -- Where feature directories live (e.g., `src/features/`, `app/domains/`)
   - **Overall layout** -- How components and services are organized (e.g., "src/features/<feature>/ for frontend, services/api/ for backend")
5. **Database/store pattern** -- How database access is structured (e.g., "Factory functions with closures over DB client", "Prisma ORM", "raw SQL with pg")
6. **Build/deploy commands** -- How the project builds and ships (e.g., `npm run build`, Docker, Podman Compose)
7. **Coverage thresholds** -- If they have existing targets (statement, branch, function, line percentages)

If the user does not have answers for optional items (coverage), use sensible defaults.

### Step 1a: Design System Path (Optional)

Some projects keep their design system (tokens, components, icons) in a
directory outside the project root -- a shared monorepo package, a sibling
directory, or an external path. By default, agents look for a
`design-system/` directory at the project root. If yours lives elsewhere,
configure the path now.

Ask conversationally (not as a list):

> Does your project have a design system directory, and is it at the default
> `design-system/` path at the project root?
>
> - **Yes, default path** (or "I don't have a design system"): press Enter.
> - **Yes, external path:** provide the absolute or project-relative path.

**If user provides a path:**

1. **Validate existence.** Check that the path exists. If not found, print
   `Directory [path] not found -- skipping design-system path configuration.`
   and continue without setting the path.
2. **Validate tokens.md.** Check that `tokens.md` exists inside the directory.
   If missing, print `No tokens.md found at [path]. Skipping -- a valid design
   system must include tokens.md.` and continue without setting the path.
3. **Set config.** Resolve to absolute path, and store in
   `.claude/pipeline-config.json` as `design_system_path`.
4. **List discovered files.** Print: `Design system path set to [path]. Found:
   [list of .md files]. [icons/ directory present | No icons/ directory]`.

**If user does not provide a path (default or absent):**

Leave `design_system_path` as `null` in `pipeline-config.json` (the template
default). Agents will fall back to convention-based detection (`design-system/`
at project root). Print nothing -- this is the common case.

**To change the path later:** re-run `/pipeline-setup` (this step is idempotent
and will re-prompt).

### Step 1b: Git Repository Detection

Before asking about branching strategy, determine git availability.

1. Run `git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null`. If this succeeds, set `git_available: true` and proceed to Step 1c (branching strategy selection).

2. If no git repo detected, inform the user:

> This project does not have a git repository.
>
> **What still works without git:**
> Eva (orchestrator), Robert (product), Sable (UX), Sarah (architect), Colby (engineer), Poirot, Sentinel (security), Agatha (docs), Brain (memory), enforcement hooks
>
> **What is unavailable without git:**
> Poirot (blind review -- needs git diff), Ellis (commit manager -- needs git), CI Watch (needs git + platform CLI), branch lifecycle management

> Would you like to create a git repository now?

3. **If user says yes:** Run `git init`, create a sensible `.gitignore` (node_modules/, .env, dist/, etc. based on detected tech stack), run `git add .gitignore && git commit -m "Initial commit"`. Set `git_available: true`, proceed to Step 1c (branching strategy selection).

4. **If user says no:** Set `git_available: false` in pipeline-config.json. Skip Step 1c entirely. Skip platform CLI detection. Skip CI Watch offer (Step 6c). Log: "Git unavailable -- skipping branching strategy, platform CLI, and CI Watch configuration." Proceed to Step 1d.

5. **If `git init` fails** (e.g., permission error): Set `git_available: false` and proceed as in step 4. Inform: "Git init failed -- proceeding without git. You can run `git init` manually later and re-run `/pipeline-setup`."

### Step 1c: Branching Strategy Selection

**Pre-checks (before asking):**

1. Check `git remote get-url origin` -- if no remote, auto-select trunk-based with message: "No remote detected -- defaulting to trunk-based. Run setup again after adding a remote to configure MR-based flows." Skip to next step.

**If git + remote exist, ask the user (one question, not a list dump):**

> Which branching strategy should the pipeline use?
> - **Trunk-Based Development** (Recommended for solo/small teams) -- Commit directly to main. Simplest setup.
> - **GitHub Flow** -- Feature branches + merge requests. Main is always deployable.
> - **GitLab Flow** -- GitHub Flow + environment branches (staging, production). For staged deployments.
> - **GitFlow** -- Formal release cycle with develop + main. For versioned software with scheduled releases.

**Follow-up per strategy:**

- **Trunk-based:** No follow-up needed.
- **GitHub Flow / GitLab Flow / GitFlow:** Detect platform from remote URL (github -> `gh`, gitlab -> `glab`). If unrecognizable, ask user. Then check CLI availability (`which gh` or `which glab`). If missing, detect package manager (try `which brew`, `which apt-get`, `which dnf` in order). If package manager found, offer: "[Strategy] requires `[cli]` CLI, which isn't installed. Install with `[pm] install [cli]`?" Options: "Install it for me" / "I'll install it later". If no package manager found: "Please install `[cli]` CLI before running the pipeline. See [install URL]."
- **GitLab Flow additional:** Ask "What are your environment branch names?" Default: staging, production.
- **GitFlow:** Platform detection only, no additional questions (conventions are standardized). Integration branch is `develop`.

**Store selection:** Write `.claude/pipeline-config.json` with the appropriate values from `source/shared/pipeline/pipeline-config.json` as the template, filled with the user's selections. The template includes `design_system_path: null` (convention-based auto-detection). Use `/load-design` after setup to configure an external design system path if needed.

### Step 1d: Model Provider Selection

Ask the user one question:

> Eva needs to know which model ID format to use when invoking agents — this is a string formatting decision, not a service selection. You're not being asked to set up a new API or pay for anything extra.
>
> Which environment is Claude Code running in?
> - **Claude Code** (default) — Standard Claude Code. You're already configured. No new setup, no new cost.
> - **AWS Bedrock** — Claude accessed via AWS Bedrock.
> - **Google Vertex AI** — Claude accessed via Google Vertex AI.

**Default:** If the user presses Enter without selecting, default to `Claude Code`. This keeps existing deployments unaffected.

**Credential note (display after selection):**

> Credentials stay in your Claude Code environment — the pipeline only needs to know which ID shape to emit. Do not put API keys or cloud credentials in pipeline-config.json.

**Provider-specific follow-up:**

- **Claude Code:** No further questions. Proceed.
- **AWS Bedrock:** Confirm: "Make sure `ANTHROPIC_AWS_REGION` is set in your Claude Code environment, and that you have either `AWS_PROFILE` or the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` pair configured. Also verify that Claude model access is enabled in the AWS Bedrock console for your region." No input required — informational only.
- **Google Vertex AI:** Confirm: "Make sure `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` and `CLOUD_ML_REGION` are set in your Claude Code environment, and that service account auth is configured (via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or `gcloud auth application-default login`)." No input required — informational only.

**Write model_provider:** The template ships with `"model_provider": "anthropic"` — no file change is needed when the user selects the default. For AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, update `.claude/pipeline-config.json` to set `model_provider` to `bedrock` or `vertex` respectively.

### Step 1e: Tech Stack Dependencies (Optional Offer)

After gathering the tech stack in Step 1, check for missing tools and offer to install them.

#### Predefined Tool Mapping Table

Use this table to map stack signals to tools that can be checked with `command -v` and installed via package manager:

| Stack / Signal | Tools to check (`command -v`) | Homebrew | apt-get | dnf | winget |
|---------------|-------------------------------|----------|---------|-----|--------|
| Node.js / JS / npm | `node`, `npm` | `node` | `nodejs npm` | `nodejs npm` | `OpenJS.NodeJS` |
| pnpm | `pnpm` | `pnpm` | `pnpm` | `pnpm` | `pnpm.pnpm` |
| yarn | `yarn` | `yarn` | `yarn` | `yarn` | `Yarn.Yarn` |
| TypeScript | `tsc` | `typescript` | `node-typescript` | `nodejs-typescript` | *(via npm: `npm i -g typescript`)* |
| Python / FastAPI / Django / Flask | `python3`, `pip` | `python` | `python3 python3-pip` | `python3 python3-pip` | `Python.Python.3` |
| ruff | `ruff` | `ruff` | `ruff` | `ruff` | `Astral.ruff` |
| mypy | `mypy` | `mypy` | `mypy` | `python3-mypy` | *(via pip: `pip install mypy`)* |
| pytest | `pytest` | `pytest` | `python3-pytest` | `python3-pytest` | *(via pip: `pip install pytest`)* |
| Go | `go` | `go` | `golang` | `golang` | `GoLang.Go` |
| Rust / Cargo | `cargo`, `rustfmt` | `rust` | `rustc cargo` | `rust cargo` | `Rustlang.Rust` |
| Ruby / Rails | `ruby`, `bundle` | `ruby` | `ruby bundler` | `ruby rubygems` | `RubyInstallerTeam.Ruby` |
| Java / Spring / Kotlin | `java`, `mvn` | `openjdk maven` | `default-jdk maven` | `java-latest-openjdk maven` | `EclipseAdoptium.Temurin` |
| Gradle | `gradle` | `gradle` | `gradle` | `gradle` | `Gradle.Gradle` |
| PHP / Laravel | `php`, `composer` | `php composer` | `php composer` | `php composer` | `PHP.PHP` |
| .NET / C# | `dotnet` | `dotnet` | `dotnet-sdk-8.0` | `dotnet-sdk-8.0` | `Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8` |
| Docker | `docker` | `docker` | `docker.io` | `docker` | `Docker.DockerDesktop` |
| PostgreSQL (client) | `psql` | `postgresql` | `postgresql-client` | `postgresql` | `PostgreSQL.PostgreSQL` |
| jq (always required) | `jq` | `jq` | `jq` | `jq` | `jqlang.jq` |
| GitHub CLI | `gh` | `gh` | `gh` | `gh` | `GitHub.cli` |
| GitLab CLI | `glab` | `glab` | `glab` | `glab` | `GitLab.GLAB` |
| Semgrep | `semgrep` | `semgrep` | `semgrep` | `semgrep` | *(via pip: `pip install semgrep`)* |

**Best-effort inference for unlisted tools:** If the user mentions a tool or framework not in the table above, attempt to look it up against the appropriate package manager's known package names. If no mapping can be found with confidence, print the tool name and instruct the user to install it manually, then continue without blocking.

#### Detection and Offer Procedure

1. **Detect package manager.** Run in order: `command -v brew` (macOS/Homebrew), `command -v apt-get` (Debian/Ubuntu), `command -v dnf` (Fedora/RHEL), `command -v winget` (Windows). Use the first one found. If none found, fall through to the "no package manager" path.

2. **Parse the tech stack** the user provided. Match signals against the table above to build a list of tools to check. Always include `jq` (required by pipeline hooks). Add `gh` if GitHub platform was selected; add `glab` if GitLab platform was selected.

3. **Check each tool** with `command -v <tool>`. Collect the list of tools that are missing from PATH.

4. **If no tools are missing:** Print "All required tools found on PATH." and continue.

5. **If tools are missing and a package manager is available:**

   > Based on your tech stack, these tools are not on PATH:
   > `[list of missing tools]`
   >
   > I can install them with `[package-manager]`:
   > ```
   > [package-manager install command(s)]
   > ```
   >
   > Options: "Install for me" / "Print the commands" / "Skip"

   - **Install for me:** Run the package manager command(s) via Bash, one package at a time. After each install, re-run `command -v <tool>` to verify. Report success or failure per tool.
   - **Print the commands:** Print the install line(s). User installs manually.
   - **Skip:** Continue without installing. Remind the user that `jq` is required by pipeline hooks and must be present before hooks fire.

6. **If tools are missing and no package manager found:**
   Print the install commands for the user's likely platform (infer from uname output or OS signals), note that no package manager was detected, and move on without blocking.

7. **If only `jq` is missing:** Prioritize the `jq` notice:
   "Pipeline hooks require `jq` — it is missing. Install with: `brew install jq` (macOS) / `apt-get install jq` (Debian) / `dnf install jq` (Fedora)." and continue without asking.

### Step 1f: Agent Roster Selection

After Step 1e, configure which agents are active for this project.

**Existing roster detection (update path):**

If `.claude/pipeline-config.json` already exists and contains an `agent_roster` key, detect the existing configuration and ask:

> You have an existing agent roster configured. Keep your current configuration or customize it?
>
> Current roster: [list enabled agents with their firing positions]
>
> - **Keep** -- Use the current roster as-is.
> - **Customize** -- Walk through agent selection again.

If the user chooses **Keep**: skip the rest of Step 1f and proceed to Step 2.
If the user chooses **Customize**: proceed with the agent selection below.

**New install / customize path:**

Explain the model first (one paragraph, not a list):

> The pipeline has a core trio that is always active: **Robert** (product review and spec, including `robert-spec`), **Sarah** (architecture), and **Colby** (build). **Sable** (UX) is also always available — invoke her any time via `/ux` or by name, no configuration needed. Beyond that, you can add any combination of the following agents. For each, you choose when it fires: after every Colby build unit, at pipeline end, or on-demand only.

Then ask about each optional agent **one at a time** (do not dump the full list):

**Poirot (blind code investigator):**
> Would you like to include **Poirot** -- the blind code reviewer? Poirot does a diff-only review of every Colby build unit and catches implementation drift before it compounds. Recommended for any team-size project.
>
> If yes: When should Poirot fire?
> - **after-every-unit** (recommended) -- Reviews each Colby build unit before Ellis commits.
> - **pipeline-end** -- Reviews the full diff at the end, not unit-by-unit.
> - **on-demand** -- Only when Eva explicitly invokes.

**Ellis (commit manager):**
> Would you like to include **Ellis** -- the commit and changelog manager? Ellis handles git add, commit, and push with a proper commit message. Without Ellis, the pipeline uses a lightweight generic commit (Eva asks "Want to commit? [y/n]" and runs standard git commands with no ceremony).
>
> If yes: Ellis fires at pipeline-end (after Poirot review). No further prompt needed.

**Agatha (documentation):**
> Would you like to include **Agatha** -- the documentation agent? Agatha writes and updates project docs after each feature is built.
>
> If yes: Agatha fires at **pipeline-end** -- she updates docs after the full pipeline completes. No further prompt needed.

**Note:** Sable (UX) is always available without configuration. She is not listed here because she does not require a firing position. Invoke her any time via `/ux` or by name.

**Sentinel (security audit):**
> Would you like to include **Sentinel** -- the security audit agent? Sentinel runs Semgrep SAST against new code. Requires the Semgrep MCP server (see Step 6a for setup). Skip now and enable in Step 6a if you want Semgrep configured first.
>
> If yes: on-demand only (security audits are always explicit).

**Sherlock (bug detective):**
> Would you like to include **Sherlock** -- the bug investigation agent? Sherlock handles user-reported bug diagnosis (distinct from Poirot's code review). Without Sherlock, Eva handles bug intake but cannot dispatch a specialist investigation.
>
> If yes: on-demand only (Sherlock is always triggered by user bug reports).

**Write the roster:**

After all agent selections, write the `agent_roster` object to `.claude/pipeline-config.json`. Always include the core trio with `firing: "core"`. For each optional agent the user selected, include it with the chosen firing position. For each agent the user declined, set `enabled: false, firing: "on-demand"` (so the roster key exists for hooks to read, but the agent is disabled).

For Agatha, always write `firing: "pipeline-end"` — no other firing position is valid.

Also set `generic_commit_enabled` in `.claude/pipeline-config.json`:
- `true` when Ellis is not enabled (or not selected)
- `false` when Ellis is enabled

**Example roster JSON (Poirot + Ellis selected; others declined):**

```json
"agent_roster": {
  "robert": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "robert-spec": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "sarah": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "colby": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "investigator": { "enabled": true, "firing": "after-every-unit" },
  "ellis": { "enabled": true, "firing": "pipeline-end" },
  "agatha": { "enabled": false, "firing": "on-demand" },
  "sentinel": { "enabled": false, "firing": "on-demand" },
  "sherlock": { "enabled": false, "firing": "on-demand" }
},
"generic_commit_enabled": false
```

**Example roster JSON (Poirot + Ellis + Agatha selected; others declined):**

```json
"agent_roster": {
  "robert": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "robert-spec": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "sarah": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "colby": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "investigator": { "enabled": true, "firing": "after-every-unit" },
  "ellis": { "enabled": true, "firing": "pipeline-end" },
  "agatha": { "enabled": true, "firing": "pipeline-end" },
  "sentinel": { "enabled": false, "firing": "on-demand" },
  "sherlock": { "enabled": false, "firing": "on-demand" }
},
"generic_commit_enabled": false
```

Note: `sable` and `sable-ux` are always-on and never appear in the roster. `robert-spec` is part of the core trio alongside `robert`.

**Minimal default (no optional agents selected):**

```json
"agent_roster": {
  "robert": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "robert-spec": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "sarah": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" },
  "colby": { "enabled": true, "firing": "core" }
},
"generic_commit_enabled": true
```

### Step 2: Read Templates

Read the template files from the plugin's templates directory. These serve as the base for each installed file. Source files are split into three directories: `source/shared/` (platform-agnostic content), `source/claude/` (Claude Code overlays), and `source/cursor/` (Cursor overlays).

**Platform detection:** If the environment variable `CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR` is set, use Cursor overlays from `source/cursor/`. Otherwise, use Claude Code overlays from `source/claude/`. `CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR` takes precedence over `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` -- when both are set, the Cursor overlay is used.

**Overlay assembly procedure (agents):** Agent persona files are assembled at install time by combining a platform-specific frontmatter overlay with shared content:

1. Read `source/{claude|cursor}/agents/{name}.frontmatter.yml` (YAML frontmatter only, no `---` delimiters)
2. Read `source/shared/agents/{name}.md` (content body, no frontmatter)
3. Concatenate: `---\n` + frontmatter content + `---\n` + body content
4. Write the assembled file to the target project (e.g., `.claude/agents/{name}.md`)

**Overlay assembly procedure (commands, rules, variants):** Same pattern -- platform-specific frontmatter overlay + shared content body, concatenated with `---` delimiters.

> **Enforcement hook bypass:** Before the first write operation below, create
> the setup-mode sentinel file to disable enforcement hooks for this session.
> This allows /pipeline-setup to write to `.claude/` paths even when
> enforcement hooks are already installed (re-install or update scenario).
>
> 1. Ensure `docs/pipeline/` exists: `mkdir -p docs/pipeline`
> 2. Create sentinel: write an empty file to `docs/pipeline/.setup-mode`
>
> After all files are installed (end of Step 6d), remove the sentinel:
> delete `docs/pipeline/.setup-mode`.
>
> The sentinel file is also checked into `.gitignore` patterns in the
> pipeline state directory template to avoid accidental commits.

### Step 3: Install Files

Copy each template to its destination in the user's project, customizing placeholders with the project-specific values gathered in Step 1.

**Installation manifest:**

Files are assembled from `source/shared/` (content) + `source/claude/` (overlays) for Claude Code, or `source/shared/` + `source/cursor/` for Cursor. Agent files use overlay assembly (frontmatter + content concatenation). Other files copy from `source/shared/` directly.

| Template Source | Destination | Purpose |

| `source/shared/agents/scout.md` + `source/claude/agents/scout.frontmatter.yml` | `.claude/agents/scout.md` | Read-only file/grep/read scout subagent persona (overlay assembly, ADR-0048) |
| `source/shared/agents/synthesis.md` + `source/claude/agents/synthesis.frontmatter.yml` | `.claude/agents/synthesis.md` | Post-scout filter/rank/trim synthesis subagent persona (overlay assembly, ADR-0048) |
| `source/shared/commands/pm.md` assembled with overlay | `.claude/commands/pm.md` | /pm slash command |
| `source/shared/commands/ux.md` assembled with overlay | `.claude/commands/ux.md` | /ux slash command |

| `source/shared/references/branch-mr-mode.md` | `.claude/references/branch-mr-mode.md` | Colby branch/MR procedures |
| `source/shared/references/telemetry-metrics.md` | `.claude/references/telemetry-metrics.md` | Telemetry metric schemas, cost table, alert thresholds (also holds JIT telemetry-capture protocol) |
| `source/shared/references/pipeline-phases.md` | `.claude/references/pipeline-phases.md` | JIT phase sizing, budget gate, investigation discipline, concurrent session detection, state file descriptions |
| `source/shared/references/worktree-isolation.md` | `.claude/references/worktree-isolation.md` | JIT worktree-per-session protocol (ADR-0038) |
| `source/shared/references/step-sizing.md` | `.claude/references/step-sizing.md` | ADR step sizing gate (S1-S5) and split heuristics |

| `source/shared/pipeline/pipeline-config.json` | `.claude/pipeline-config.json` | Branching strategy configuration |
| `source/shared/variants/branch-lifecycle-{strategy}.md` assembled with overlay | `.claude/rules/branch-lifecycle.md` | Branch lifecycle rules (selected variant only) |

**Total: 30 mandatory files across 5 directories (before hooks and config).**

**State file guard:** The 5 pipeline state files in `docs/pipeline/` and `.claude/pipeline-config.json` are live state — they contain active pipeline progress, user decisions, and project configuration. On re-install or update:
- If the destination file already exists, **skip it** — do not overwrite
- If the destination file does not exist, copy the template (fresh install)
- To force a reset, the user must explicitly delete the file first

This guard does NOT apply to rules, agents, commands, references, or hooks — those are always overwritten from source templates on re-sync.

**pipeline-config.json missing-key merge (G-151 note item 8):** The 5
`docs/pipeline/` files stay on the plain skip rule above — nothing further
happens to them. `.claude/pipeline-config.json` (or `.cursor/pipeline-config.json`
on Cursor) gets one additional step when the file already exists: run
`scripts/merge-pipeline-config.sh` with plugin-rooted paths -- the script
lives in the plugin, not the target project, so a bare relative path
resolves nowhere once setup is running inside the target project's own
working directory. Same platform detection as Step 3c (`CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR`
env var), same plugin-root variable per platform as the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
example in the "Where Files Are Installed" contract above (Cursor's
equivalent is `${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, per `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`'s
own hook registration):

```bash
if [ -n "${CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR:-}" ]; then
  PLUGIN_ROOT="${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
  INSTALLED=".cursor/pipeline-config.json"
else
  PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
  INSTALLED=".claude/pipeline-config.json"
fi
"${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/merge-pipeline-config.sh" \
  "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/source/shared/pipeline/pipeline-config.json" \
  "$INSTALLED"
```

This adds any top-level key the template
(`source/shared/pipeline/pipeline-config.json`) has that the installed file
lacks, using the template's value. This is the same mechanism "Preserve an
existing enforcement-config.json" (`hooks.md`, Step 3a) already uses for
`enforcement-config.json` — `jq -s '.[0] + .[1]'`, right-hand side (installed)
wins, one-line outcome report, malformed JSON left untouched with a warning.
Keys already present in the installed file are never changed, even when
their value differs from the template or is empty.

Run this merge **after** all of Step 1's interactive setup questions have
completed — in particular after Step 1f's existing-`agent_roster` detection,
which reads the installed file's pre-merge state to decide whether to ask
the roster questions at all. Running the merge earlier could add a key
before the question that depends on its absence gets asked.

**`agent_roster` is never added by this merge**, even though the template
has it and an older installed file may lack it. Its absence is the exact
signal Step 1f's "Existing roster detection" reads (see `agent_roster`
above) — mechanically adding it here would defeat that check on every
re-run. The script excludes it unconditionally; it is not a matter of the
template happening to omit it.

Report the outcome in one line, same style as the enforcement-config.json
report:
- **Keys added:** `pipeline-config.json preserved; added missing keys: <comma-separated list>.`
- **Nothing missing:** `pipeline-config.json preserved; no keys added.`
- **Malformed JSON:** `WARNING: .claude/pipeline-config.json is not valid JSON -- left unchanged. Fix it by hand, then re-run /pipeline-setup.`
- **Fresh install (file didn't exist):** no merge runs — the plain copy above already installed the current template verbatim.

`scripts/merge-pipeline-config.sh` is tested directly in
`tests/scripts/test_merge_pipeline_config.py` (existing-key preservation,
missing-key addition, `agent_roster` exclusion, malformed-JSON
byte-identity) — it is not documentation prose the skill re-derives at
install time.

See `hooks.md` for hook script installation (Step 3a), version marker (Step 3b), and Cursor rules sync (Step 3c).

### Step 4: Customize Placeholders

The following placeholders in template files must be replaced with project-specific values:

| Placeholder | Replaced With | Example |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `{project_name}` | Project name for telemetry | `syntetiq`, `my-app` |
| `{{TECH_STACK}}` | Project tech stack description | "React 19 (Vite), Express.js, PostgreSQL" |
| `{{LINT_COMMAND}}` | Lint command | `npm run lint` |
| `{{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}}` | Type check command | `npm run typecheck` |
| `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` | Full test suite command | `npm test` |
| `{{TEST_SINGLE_COMMAND}}` | Single file test command | `npx vitest run` |
| `{{SOURCE_STRUCTURE}}` | Feature/source directory layout | "src/features/<feature>/ for UI, services/api/ for backend" |
| `{{DB_PATTERN}}` | Database access pattern | "Factory functions with closures over DB client" |
| `{{BUILD_COMMAND}}` | Build command | `npm run build` |
| `{{COVERAGE_THRESHOLDS}}` | Coverage targets | "stmt=70, branch=65, fn=75, lines=70" |
| `{source_dir}` | Project source directory | `src/`, `lib/`, `app/` |
| `{features_dir}` | Feature directory pattern | `src/features/`, `app/domains/` |

**Replacement method — IMPORTANT:** Use the Read tool to load each installed file, perform substitutions in memory, then write the result back with the Write tool. Do NOT use `sed` for these replacements. BSD `sed` on macOS does not support multi-line replacement strings — values like `{{TECH_STACK}}` or `{{SOURCE_STRUCTURE}}` may contain newlines, which cause `sed` to misread the characters after the newline as flags and fail with `bad flag in substitute command`.

See `post-install.md` for CLAUDE.md writing (Step 5), the installation summary and optional-feature offers (Step 6 through 6d), and lightweight reconfig (Step 7).

## Important Notes

- **Do not overwrite existing files without asking.** If `.claude/rules/` or `.claude/agents/` already exists with content, ask the user whether to merge or replace.
- **Git-track the installed files.** Recommend the user commits the pipeline files so the system persists across clones and team members.
- **Templates are the source of truth.** If a template file is missing from the plugin's templates directory, report which file is missing and skip it rather than generating content from scratch.
- **Validate after install.** After writing all files, verify that Claude Code recognizes the slash commands by listing them. If the rules files are not being loaded, check that they are in `.claude/rules/` (Claude Code auto-loads all files in this directory).

</gate>

See `directory-layout.md` for the directory reference table (what each installed directory is loaded by and what it does).
