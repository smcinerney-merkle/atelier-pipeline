"""Structural tests for ADR-0054 -- pipeline-side concerns only.

Multi-Provider LLM Abstraction (Brain) and Pipeline Provider Routing.

ADR-0054 had two halves:
  - Brain-side: llm-provider.mjs adapters, config.mjs backward compat,
    embedding dimension checks. These lived in `brain/lib/*` while the
    brain was bundled inside this plugin.
  - Pipeline-side: model_provider field in pipeline-config.json, Bedrock
    and Vertex model IDs in pipeline-models.md, and Step 1d in the
    pipeline-setup skill.

Per ADR-0055 Phase 3 the brain moved to the standalone mybrain plugin and
`brain/` was deleted from this repo. The brain-side behavioral tests now
live in mybrain; only the pipeline-side structural assertions remain here.
