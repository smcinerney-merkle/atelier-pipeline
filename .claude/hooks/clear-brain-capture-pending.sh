# clear-brain-capture-pending.sh -- PostToolUse hook (ADR-0053, decoupled per ADR-0055).
#
# Per ADR-0055, this hook is no longer scoped to a specific brain MCP
# server name in settings.json. Its PostToolUse registration omits the
# `matcher` field, so it fires on every PostToolUse event. Internally,
# the hook reads `tool_name` from the stdin payload and only acts when
# the tool name ends with the suffix `__agent_capture` -- the brain
# protocol's `agent_capture` tool, regardless of which plugin or
# `claude mcp add` registration produced it.
#
# On a matching tool name, deletes
# {pipeline_state_dir}/.pending-brain-capture.json so the PreToolUse
# gate (enforce-brain-capture-gate.sh) lets Eva spawn the next agent.
#
# Idempotent: exits 0 cleanly when the file is absent. Always exits 0,
# never blocks -- PostToolUse is observation, not enforcement.
