# Pipeline Model Selection (Mechanical -- Eva Does Not Choose)

Loads automatically when Eva reads `{pipeline_state_dir}/` files. Model and
effort assignment follows a 4-tier task-class model: the agent's task class
determines the base `model` + `effort` pair, and a small set of promotion
signals adjust `effort` by exactly one rung. Eva sets both parameters
explicitly in every Agent tool invocation by looking up the tables below.
There is no discretion, no judgment call, no "this one feels complex enough
for Opus." The tables are the rule.

Each agent's persona frontmatter also declares its base `model` and `effort`
so the runtime has a sane fallback. The tables below remain the authoritative
source for Eva's invocation-time selection.

Model follows task class, not agent identity. A single agent can occupy
different task classes on different runs. Pipeline sizing is a tier-picker
signal only; it does not set the model.

<model-table id="task-class-tiers">

## Four-Tier Task-Class Model

| Tier | Task class | Model | Base effort | Typical agents | Effort adjustment signal |
|------|------------|-------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Tier 1 | Mechanical -- no reasoning | Sonnet / Haiku | low | Ellis, scout (haiku), Distillator | -- (stays low) |
| Tier 2 | Supporting reasoning -- review / acceptance / compliance / synthesis | Sonnet (see opus-escalation gate for per-agent Opus conditions) | medium | Robert (acceptance), Sable (acceptance), Sentinel, Agatha, Synthesis, Colby (rework), Colby (first-build Small) | Read-only / mechanical -- -1 rung (floor low) |
| Tier 3 | Critical-path reasoning -- creates / verifies shipped artifact | Sonnet (see opus-escalation gate for per-agent Opus conditions) | high / medium | Colby (first-build Medium+), Poirot, Darwin | (no further promotion -- `high` is ceiling) |
| Tier 4 | Architectural design | Opus | high | Sarah | (already at ceiling; `high` is the ceiling value) |

</model-table>

### Adaptive-Thinking Rationale

Per Anthropic's Opus 4.7 guidance, `effort` controls a model's propensity to
think adaptively, not a fixed thinking budget. **Fixed thinking budgets are unsupported** in Opus 4.7.
At `medium`, adaptive-thinking capacity is bounded
even when the model wants to reach for more -- appropriate for coverage-oriented
review where over-reading inflates false positives (Poirot standard review). At `high`,
full adaptive thinking is available -- appropriate for execution with branching
sub-decisions (Colby first-build, Poirot standard review). `max` is evaluation-only: prone to overthinking and
degraded production output. Ceiling stays `high`. `xhigh` and `max` are forbidden on production workloads -- both cause excessive context burn without quality gain.

### Opus 4.7 Web-Search Regression

Opus 4.7 has a known regression on agentic web search. No pipeline agent
tool list includes `WebSearch` or `WebFetch`. Eva's auto-routing must not
synthesize these tools into agent invocations -- if a task genuinely
requires live web data, surface that as a constraint to the user rather
than routing to an agent that will silently degrade.

<model-table id="promotion-signals">

## Promotion Signals (one rung each)

| Signal | Applies to tier | Effect |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Task is read-only evidence collection (no ADR, no code) | 2 | -1 rung (floor low) |
| Task is mechanical (format, rename, config-only) | 2, 3 | -1 rung (floor low) |

**Rules:**

1. Promotions stack to a maximum of one rung above base per signal. If two
   signals both apply, effort still goes up exactly one rung (not two). The
   table is not additive; signals are existence-checks, not scores.
2. **Floor: `low`. Ceiling: `high`.** Effort is never below `low` and never
   above `high`. Demotions cannot take effort below the floor; promotions
   cannot take it above the ceiling. **`xhigh` and `max` are forbidden** (see Enforcement
   Rule 5).
3. Tier 1 effort does not adjust -- base `low` is both floor and ceiling for
   this tier. The pattern-matching surface is bounded; more effort does not
   rescue mechanical misapplication, and demotion below `low` is impossible.
4. Tier 4 (Sarah) is already at `high` base; further signals have no effect.

## Per-Agent Assignment Table

Authoritative runtime lookup. Eva sets `model` and `effort` in every Agent
tool invocation based on this table plus the promotion signals above.

| Agent | Tier | Base model | Base effort | Rationale (one line) |
|-------|------|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Sarah** | 4 | opus | high | Architectural deliberation dominates pattern-matching; `high` is sufficient for ADR-scale deliberation |
| **Colby** | 3 (first-build Medium+) | sonnet | high | Default first-build tier; sonnet/high covers execution sub-decisions. Opus only via escalation gate (core abstraction refactor, user-confirmed) |
| **Colby** | 2 (rework, first-build Small) | sonnet | medium | Rework and small first-build are supporting tasks; Sonnet/medium covers coverage-oriented review without Opus cost |

| **Poirot (investigator)** | 3 | sonnet | high | Blind diff review; sonnet/high covers verification sub-decisions. Opus only via escalation gate (security-critical code, user-confirmed) |
| **Sherlock** | 3 | sonnet | high | Diagnose-only bug hunt; sonnet/high covers multi-layer tracing. Opus only via escalation gate (bug spans 3+ system layers simultaneously, user-confirmed); isolation from session context is the load-bearing property |
| **Robert (acceptance)** | 2 | sonnet | medium | Spec-vs-implementation diff; structured review is Sonnet-capable |
| **robert-spec (producer)** | 2 | sonnet | medium | Spec authoring; sonnet/medium covers structured generative work. Opus only via escalation gate (novel capability with no existing pattern, user-confirmed) |
| **Sable (acceptance)** | 2 | sonnet | medium | UX-vs-implementation diff; structured review is Sonnet-capable |
| **sable-ux (producer)** | 2 | sonnet | medium | UX doc authoring; sonnet/medium covers structured design work. Opus only via escalation gate (novel interaction paradigm, user-confirmed) |
| **Sentinel** | 2 | sonnet | low | Pattern-matching SAST with effort: low suppresses Opus reasoning; Sonnet matches the actual workload. Mechanical task signal -- effort demoted medium→low. |
| **Agatha** | 2 | sonnet | medium | Documentation authoring; sonnet/medium covers structured writing. Opus only via escalation gate (full information architecture restructure, user-confirmed). Always Tier 2 (no runtime override) |
| **synthesis** | 2 | sonnet | low | Filter/rank/trim of scout output; no judgment, no opinions. Registered subagent (ADR-0048) — frontmatter declares the bare logical alias `model: sonnet`; invocation omits the `model` parameter |
| **Ellis** | 1 | sonnet | low | Commit-message composition; Sonnet/low cheaper per successful pass than Haiku rework |
| **Distillator** | 1 | sonnet | low | Structured compression; Sonnet/low preserves load-bearing facts Haiku drops |
| **scout** | 1 | haiku | low | File/grep/read only; no synthesis. Registered subagent (ADR-0048) — frontmatter declares the bare logical alias `model: haiku`; invocation omits the `model` parameter |

## Provider-Shaped Model ID Reference (ADR-0054)

> **CRITICAL — Agent tool constraint:** Always pass the logical alias
> (`"sonnet"`, `"opus"`, or `"haiku"`) to the Agent tool's `model` parameter.
> Full model ID strings (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6` — the exact string observed
> failing, not a claim about the current model generation) have been observed to cause
> `Invalid tool parameters` errors in current versions of Claude Code, even
> though the documentation lists them as valid. Claude Code resolves the alias
> to the appropriate provider ID internally. Do not pre-translate.

The table below is a **reference** mapping logical names to provider-shaped IDs.
It is used for documentation, for Bedrock/Vertex install-time configuration
(e.g. rewriting frontmatter for non-Anthropic deployments), and for external
API contexts — not for Agent tool invocations.

| Logical name | anthropic (default) | bedrock | vertex |
|--------------|---------------------|---------|--------|
| **opus** | `claude-opus-5` | `anthropic.claude-opus-5` | `claude-opus-5` |
| **sonnet** | `claude-sonnet-5` | `anthropic.claude-sonnet-5` | `claude-sonnet-5` |
| **haiku** | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | `anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` | `claude-haiku@001` |

**Resolution rules:**

1. Eva reads `model_provider` from `pipeline-config.json` once at session
   boot and caches the value. Default is `anthropic` -- existing deployments
   are unaffected until they opt in.
2. For every Agent tool invocation, Eva passes the **logical name** (`sonnet`,
   `opus`, or `haiku`) directly. No translation step. Claude Code resolves
   the alias to the correct provider-shaped ID internally based on its own
   deployment configuration.
3. Registered subagents (every persona, including scout and synthesis --
   ADR-0048) declare their tier in frontmatter. **In this fork that value is
   the family alias (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`), not a pinned `claude-*` ID**:
   the host's `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` / `_SONNET_` / `_HAIKU_` settings
   decide the concrete model, so a new model generation is a settings edit,
   not a 14-file edit. `tests/test_frontmatter_model_ids.py` enforces this.
   Where this document names a pinned ID for a Claude agent, read it as the
   tier, not the model. Eva omits the `model` parameter when invoking these
   subagents -- the frontmatter handles it.
4. Unknown `model_provider` values are a configuration error. Eva does not
   fall back silently; she surfaces the unknown value and stops.

**Voyage AI is permanently excluded.** Gemini is deferred (768-dim
embeddings incompatible with the brain's `vector(1536)` schema, non-OpenAI
wire format) -- not because of routing complexity, but because the
schema-migration cost has not been paid. See ADR-0054 for the full decision.

</model-table>

## Runtime Lookup Procedure

For every Agent tool invocation:

1. Identify the agent and the task class it is performing on this run
   (for example, Colby first-build Medium is a Tier 3 task; Colby rework is
   a Tier 2 task).
2. Look up the base `model` + base `effort` in the Per-Agent Assignment Table.
3. Apply promotion signals from the Promotion Signals table; effort moves by
   at most one rung regardless of how many signals fire.
4. Clamp to the floor (`low`) and ceiling (`high`). `xhigh` and `max` are forbidden.
5. Set `model` and `effort` explicitly on the Agent tool call. The `model`
   value is always the **logical alias** from the table (`"sonnet"`, `"opus"`,
   or `"haiku"`). Never pass a full model ID string — the Agent tool rejects
   them. Omission of either parameter is a violation of the enforcement gate below.

<gate id="model-enforcement">

## Enforcement Rules

1. **No discretion.** Eva does not choose models or effort. The agent's task
   class determines the tier, the tier determines base `model` + base
   `effort`, and the promotion signals mechanically adjust effort by one rung.
   If Eva is about to invoke an agent at a `model` or `effort` that does not
   match the lookup, that is a configuration error -- same severity class as
   invoking Poirot with spec context. **Exception:** Any agent listed in the
   `opus-escalation` gate below may be escalated to `opus` only by passing
   that gate (user-confirmed). Sarah is excluded -- she has no escalation gate
   and is always `opus / high`. Eva's judgment alone is not sufficient.
2. **Explicit in every invocation.** Both the `model` and `effort` parameters
   MUST be set explicitly in every Agent tool invocation. No relying on
   frontmatter defaults. Omitting either parameter is a violation.
3. **Ambiguous sizing defaults to higher tier.** If Eva has not yet confirmed
   the pipeline sizing (Small / Medium / Large), she MUST treat sizing as
   Large for tier-selection purposes only: Colby uses its higher tier
   (Tier 3) on first-build. Effort is NOT affected by ambiguous sizing --
   the Large effort-promotion signal was removed by ADR-0042. Once sizing is
   confirmed, subsequent invocations use the correct tier.
4. **Sizing changes propagate immediately.** If Eva re-sizes a pipeline
   mid-flight (e.g., Small escalates to Medium after discovering scope), all
   subsequent invocations use the new sizing's tier / signal lookup.
   Already-completed invocations are not re-run.
5. **`xhigh` and `max` effort are forbidden.** Per Anthropic's Opus 4.7 adaptive-thinking
   guidance and tokenizer regression research, both `xhigh` and `max` cause excessive
   context burn on production workloads without quality gain. Ceiling is `high`. Eva MUST NOT invoke
   any agent at `effort: xhigh` or `effort: max`. Hypothetical invocations with either value are a configuration error, same class as omitting `effort`.

<gate id="opus-escalation">

## Opus Escalation Gate

Applies to six agents. Sarah is excluded -- she has no escalation gate and is always `opus / high`.

| Agent | Qualifying condition (one, non-negotiable) | Escalated model / effort |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Colby** (first-build only) | Task is a core abstraction refactor -- a change that alters how the system is reasoned about, not merely how it works. Reshuffling internals without changing the conceptual model does not qualify. | `opus / high` |
| **Poirot** | Review covers security-critical code (auth, crypto, or access control). | `opus / high` |
| **Sherlock** | Bug spans 3 or more system layers simultaneously. | `opus / high` |
| **robert-spec** | Feature introduces a capability with no existing pattern in the codebase to draw from. | `opus / medium` |
| **sable-ux** | Feature introduces an interaction paradigm not present elsewhere in the product. | `opus / medium` |
| **Agatha** | Work restructures the entire information architecture (not just adds or updates individual docs). | `opus / medium` |

**Protocol (applies to each agent above):**

1. Eva identifies that the qualifying condition may apply and asks the user exactly one question before invoking the agent. The question must state which condition Eva judges as met and ask whether to proceed with Opus or Sonnet.
2. User confirms → invoke the agent at the escalated `model / effort` shown in the table.
3. User declines, or the answer is ambiguous → invoke the agent at its base `sonnet / effort` (effort stays at the agent's base tier; no demotion).

**Colby rework is always `sonnet / medium`.** The escalation gate does not apply to Colby rework runs regardless of how the original first-build was invoked.

**Eva's judgment alone is not the gate.** The user must confirm for every agent. Skipping the question and invoking at `opus` is a violation of Enforcement Rule 1.
