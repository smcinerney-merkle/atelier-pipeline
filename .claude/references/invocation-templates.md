# Invocation Templates

<!-- CONFIGURE: docs/product, docs/ux, docs/architecture, source/, tests/,
     echo "no single test configured" (single test), pytest tests/ (full suite) -->

## Shared Protocols (apply to all templates below)

**Brain-context injection:** Eva prefetches via `agent_search` and injects
into `<brain-context>`. Captures are gated mechanically by the three-hook
loop (ADR-0053): SubagentStop marks the pending capture for allowlisted
agents, PreToolUse on `Agent` blocks Eva's next invocation until she calls
`agent_capture` with curated content, PostToolUse on `agent_capture` clears
the marker. Omit `<brain-context>` when brain unavailable.

Example fully-formed `<brain-context>` block:
```xml
<brain-context>
  <thought type="decision" agent="sarah" phase="architecture"
           captured_by="robert@sfeir.design" created_at="2026-03-15T14:22:00Z" relevance="0.87">
    Use ltree scoping for all agent_search calls; unscoped queries leak cross-project content.
  </thought>
</brain-context>
```
Agents use `captured_by` and `created_at` to weigh credibility -- a recent
thought from the same agent in the same scope carries more weight than a
months-old thought from a different feature.

**Standard READ items (included in every invocation, not listed per template):**
`{config_dir}/references/retro-lessons.md`, `{config_dir}/references/agent-preamble.md`

**Persona constraints apply:** Templates list only task-specific constraints
that supplement the persona. Do not duplicate persona-level rules.

**Telemetry timing:** Eva records `start_time`/`end_time` around every Agent
tool invocation. `duration_ms = end_time - start_time`.

**SendMessage resume capture (Sarah and Poirot only):** When Eva invokes Sarah
(templates 1, 2) or Poirot (template 14) via the Agent tool, she captures the
`agentId` returned in the tool result and holds it in her session context
keyed by agent name. On a recognized continuation trigger (Sarah revision
after a Poirot structural finding, Poirot scoped re-run after a Colby fix),
Eva uses `SendMessage` against the captured `agentId` instead of spawning a
fresh Agent -- this skips the re-read cost on these two high-context agents.
**Address by UUID, not name.** The `to` value passed to `SendMessage` MUST be
the captured `agentId` UUID string (e.g. `"a0f21b3784edcb4d4"`) returned in
the Agent tool result -- not the agent name. Name-based addressing
(`"sarah"`, `"poirot"`) only resolves for currently-running teammates and
returns "not currently addressable" for stopped subagents, which is exactly
the resume target. UUID is the only valid `to` value for resume.
No other agent qualifies; capture is in-session only and is discarded at
session boundaries (compaction, restart, crash). Full rule:
`{config_dir}/rules/agent-system.md` (`<protocol id="sendmessage-resume">`).

### Scout Research Brief (scout, pre-Sarah, Medium+Large)
Three scouts launched in parallel by Eva. Each receives one focused prompt.

**Patterns scout:**
<task>Find existing code patterns relevant to [feature area]. Grep for similar feature directories, hooks, naming conventions, shared utilities.</task>
<constraints>- Return file:line results only. No opinions. Max 20 results.</constraints>
<output>patterns: [{file, line, pattern_description}]</output>

**Manifest scout:**
<task>Check dependency manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.) for packages relevant to [feature area].</task>
<constraints>- Return package names and versions only. Flag anything outdated or potentially conflicting.</constraints>
<output>deps: [{name, version, relevance}]</output>

**Blast-radius scout:**
<task>Identify source files likely in scope for [feature area]: files matching the feature name, adjacent modules, integration points, test files.</task>
<constraints>- Return file paths only. Max 15 files. Prefer specific over broad.</constraints>
<output>blast_radius_files: [path, ...]</output>

**Post-scout synthesis:** After all three scouts return, Eva invokes Template 2c (scout-synthesis) before invoking Sarah. Scout raw output is passed to the synthesis agent, not directly to Sarah. Synthesis produces the compact `<research-brief>` block consumed by Sarah.
</template>

<template id="codebase-investigation">
### Codebase Investigation (scout → synthesis)
Ad-hoc read-only surveys (security mapping, architecture reviews, dependency tracing). No ADR, no code changes. Eva fans out parallel area scouts — `Agent(subagent_type: "scout")`, one concern per scout, facts only, `findings: [{file, line, description}]`. Passes evidence to `Agent(subagent_type: "synthesis", effort: "low")` via named `<scout-evidence>` blocks. Synthesis produces structured findings table with file:line evidence. DoR/DoD.
</template>

<template id="scout-synthesis">
### Scout Synthesis (synthesis filter/rank/trim, post-scout, pre-primary-agent)
<task>Filter, rank, and trim scout outputs into the named block for the primary agent. Emit only the required field names per the output shape. No opinions, no design proposals.</task>
Eva invokes ONE synthesis agent after scouts complete. Synthesis reads all
scout outputs and produces the compact block consumed by Sarah/Colby/Poirot.
Does NOT form opinions. Filters, ranks, trims only.

**Invocation:** `Agent(subagent_type: "synthesis", effort: "low")` with the
synthesis output-shape prompt embedded inline. The `model` parameter is
omitted; resolution falls through to the synthesis frontmatter
(`sonnet`) per ADR-0048.

Block populated: `<research-brief>` (Sarah) / `<colby-context>` (Colby) / `<qa-evidence>` (Poirot).

**Per-primary-agent output shape:**

Sarah synthesis fills `<research-brief>`:
- Top patterns (<=5 ranked by relevance): [file:line + one-line description]
- Confirmed blast-radius (<=10 files with reason): [list]
- Manifest notes: [conflicts or "none"]
- Brain context (top 3 thoughts): [excerpts; omit when brain unavailable]

Colby synthesis fills `<colby-context>`:
- Key functions/blocks in scope for this step (NOT full files -- extract only the
  functions/classes/blocks the step will touch): [list]
- Relevant patterns to replicate (<=5, file:line + one-line description): [list]
- Files pre-loaded (full content only if <=50 lines): [list]
- Brain context (top 2 patterns for this step): [excerpts; omit when brain unavailable]

Poirot synthesis fills `<qa-evidence>`:
- Changed sections (per file: ONLY the changed functions/blocks, NOT full file): [list]
- Test baseline: [N passed, N failed, failing test names only]
- Risk areas (specific functions/paths worth scrutiny): [list]
- Brain context (prior QA findings on this feature area): [excerpts; omit when brain unavailable]

**Forbidden in all synthesis output:**
- Full file contents over 50 lines
- Prose explanation of what the primary agent should decide
- Design proposals or architectural recommendations
- Ranked "best approach" narratives
- Commentary beyond one-line descriptions on file:line entries

**Skip conditions (mirror scout skips):**
- Sarah: Small and Micro pipelines
- Colby: Micro pipelines AND re-invocation fix cycles
- Poirot: Scoped re-run mode

<constraints>
- Filter/rank/trim only -- no opinions.
- Emit the exact field names above. Missing required fields = BLOCKED by primary-agent DoR.
- No file content over 50 lines per entry.
- Brain context field omitted when `brain_available: false`.
</constraints>
<output>The named block (Sarah/Colby/Poirot), populated per shape above.</output>
</template>

<template id="brain-hydrate-scout">
### Brain Hydrate Scout (scout, Phase 2a of brain-hydrate skill)
One scout per artifact category. Eva copies this template verbatim into every scout Agent call and fills `{FILES}` from the Phase 1 inventory for that category. The `=== FILE:` delimiter format is required — the downstream Sonnet extractor and `enforce-scout-swarm.sh` both depend on it.

**Invocation:** `Agent(subagent_type: "scout")` with the prompt below. The
`model` parameter is omitted; resolution falls through to the scout
frontmatter (`haiku`) per ADR-0048.

```
<task>Read the files listed in <read> below. Return the full content of every file exactly as-is. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or omit any part of any file. Do not add commentary, headings, or analysis. Raw file dumps only.</task>
<read>
{FILES}
</read>
<constraints>
- No prose, no summaries, no opinions.
- Every file in <read> must appear in output exactly once.
- Reproduce each file completely — no truncation.
</constraints>
<output>
For each file, output using this exact delimiter format:

=== FILE: {path} ===
[full file content]
=== END FILE ===

Repeat for every file in <read>.
</output>
```

`{FILES}` is replaced with the Phase 1 file paths for the category (one path per line). See `skills/brain-hydrate/SKILL.md §Scout Invocation Template` for Phase 1 inventory rules and category-to-block-element mapping.

**Post-scout:** Sonnet subagent receives all scout outputs concatenated by category block element (`<adrs>`, `<specs>`, `<ux-docs>`, `<pipeline-artifacts>`, `<git-history>`). See brain-hydrate SKILL.md §Phase 2b.
